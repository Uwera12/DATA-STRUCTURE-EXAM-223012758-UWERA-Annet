The following text describes the breakdown of a simple C++ program that outputs text to the console:
USING NAMESPACE STD;: This line tells the C++ program to use the standard namespace (std), which contains functions, objects, and variables to prevent naming conflicts. By including using namespace std;, you don't need to prefix library functions like cout or cin with std::.
INT MAIN (): This is the main function where program execution starts. Every C++ program requires a main() function. The int return type signifies the function will return an integer, usually 0, to indicate that the program executed successfully.
COUT << "Hello, World!";: The cout object is used for displaying output on the console. The << operator is the stream insertion operator, which sends the text to the output stream. "Hello, World!" is the message that will appear on the screen when the program runs.
RETURN 0;: This marks the end of the main function and returns 0, signaling successful execution. A return value of 0 indicates that the program ran without errors.
Execution Flow:
The program starts with the execution of main().
The using namespace std; line allows easy access to standard library functions.
The message "Hello, World!" is displayed using cout.
The program concludes by returning 0, showing successful completion.

Question 2:
This explanation breaks down the key parts of a C++ program with variable declarations:
using namespace std;: This instructs the compiler to use the standard namespace, meaning functions like cout, cin, and endl can be used without the std:: prefix.
int main(): The main() function is where the program starts. It returns an integer, usually 0, to indicate that the program completed without issues.
Variable Declarations:
Integer Variable (age): int age = 20; - This defines an integer variable named age initialized to 20.
Double Variable (price): double price = 19.99; - This defines a double variable named price initialized to 19.99, used for storing decimal values.
Character Variable (grade): char grade = 'A'; - This defines a char variable named grade initialized to the character 'A'.
String Variable (name): string name = "Alice"; - This defines a string variable name initialized with the value "Alice".
Output Statements:
Output Name: cout << "Name: " << name << endl; - This prints "Name: " followed by the value of name ("Alice") and then a newline.
Output Age: cout << "Age: " << age << endl; - This prints "Age: " followed by the value of age (20) and a newline.
Output Price: cout << "Price: $" << price << endl; - This prints "Price: $" followed by the value of price (19.99) and a newline.
Output Grade: cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl; - This prints "Grade: " followed by the value of grade ('A') and a newline.
return 0;: This marks the end of the main() function and returns 0, indicating successful completion.

Question 3:
This C++ program asks the user to input their name and age, then displays a personalized greeting message:
using namespace std;: This tells the compiler to use the standard namespace, allowing functions like cout, cin, and endl to be used without std::.
int main(): This is the main function where the program begins execution. The int return type indicates it returns an integer, typically 0 to show successful execution.
Variable Declarations:
string name;: This declares a string variable name to store the user's name.
int age;: This declares an integer variable age to store the user's age.
Input for Name:
cout << "Enter your name: ";: This prompts the user to input their name.
cin >> name;: This reads the user's name and stores it in the name variable.
Input for Age:
cout << "Enter your age: ";: This prompts the user to input their age.
cin >> age;: This reads the user's age and stores it in the age variable.
Output the Greeting:
cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You are " << age << " years old." << endl;: This displays a personalized greeting using the values of name and age.
return 0;: This signals the end of the main() function and indicates successful completion.
Expected Output: The program greets the user by name and mentions their age.

Question 4:
This C++ program demonstrates basic arithmetic operations using two integer variables, a and b:
Variable Declarations:
int a = 10, b = 3; - This initializes two integers: a is set to 10 and b is set to 3.
Sum Calculation:
cout << "Sum: " << a + b << endl;: This calculates and prints the sum of a and b (10 + 3 = 13) followed by a newline.
Difference Calculation:
cout << "Difference: " << a - b << endl;: This calculates and prints the difference between a and b (10 - 3 = 7) followed by a newline.
Product Calculation:
cout << "Product: " << a * b << endl;: This calculates and prints the product of a and b (10 * 3 = 30) followed by a newline.
Quotient Calculation:
cout << "Quotient: " << a / b << endl;: This calculates and prints the quotient of a divided by b (10 / 3 = 3). Since both a and b are integers, the result will be an integer, and the fractional part is discarded.
Remainder Calculation:
cout << "Remainder: " << a % b << endl;: This calculates and prints the remainder when a is divided by b (10 % 3 = 1) followed by a newline
